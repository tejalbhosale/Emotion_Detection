# EMOTION DETECTION

Welcome to the "EMOTION DETECTION" project! This model, using Python and machine learning, capable of identifying and classifying emotions from facial expressions in images. 

# Technologies Used

This project leverages the following technologies:

* Python
* Machine Leaning
* tensorflow
* Keras
* NumPy
* Tinker
* matplotlib
* Image Processing
* Convolutional neutral network(CNN)

# To use our Emotion Detection Model 
* 1.Just clone or download and unzip our resporatory 
* 2.install tensorflow and cv2 in the system using pip 
* 3.run the gui.py file 
* 4.upload the image in the gui 
* 5.click on the Detect button to detect the emotion.

# Thank you for exploring the "EMOTION DETECTION"!
